- Standards: DACS, EAD, Dublin Core, PREMIS, AAT/FAST.

## Process Overview
1. Discovery & Assessment
2. Normalization (series model, vocabularies)
3. Arrangement & Description (mapping legacy → controlled)
4. Digitization & Digital Asset Policy
5. Metadata Crosswalks (ASpace/Omeka, DC/EAD, PREMIS)
6. Ingest & Validation
7. QA/QC & Reconciliation
8. Publication & Access
9. Governance, Rights, Restrictions
10. Sustainability & Change Management

- Location and container logic for physical/oversize.

## Workstreams
- Intake & Appraisal
- Arrangement & Description
- Metadata & Crosswalks
- Digitization & Digital Preservation
- Systems & Automation
- Access & Outreach

## Templates & Tools
- Checklists (intake, transfer, box list)
- CSV/Excel templates (ASpace import, controlled lists)
- Scripts (validation, mapping, QC)
- Policy boilerplates (restrictions, rights, reuse)

## Quality Assurance
- Validation rules, acceptance criteria, and spot-check sampling plans.

## Change Log
- Versioning of procedures and decisions.
