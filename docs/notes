Archivists + executive director: authority control - naming versions, birth name, aka names, entrance vs. reception (when they get their religious names) vs first vows vs final vows vs other names and dates.
    * component identifiers: what to include and what not to include? HARC(yes)_001(collection# yes)_3(series# yes)_4(subseries[was a maybe until Exec director stated we need it as padding even if none included]_5(box# yes)_12(folder# yes)_0001(item# yes)
        * equals - 0000 as padding = HARC_001_2_0000_12_3_0001
    * access and restrictions - should this be the per-congregation or a general standard for all? How does this work?

* standardize finding aid elements - what is required and what is optional? (Like Portal)
